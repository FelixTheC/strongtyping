# Welcome to strongtyping
<p>Decorator which <b>checks at Runtime</b> whether the function is called with the correct type of parameters.<br> 
And <b><em>raises</em> TypeMisMatch</b> if the used parameters in a function call where invalid.</p>

### The problem
- Highlighting
    - __Some__ IDE's will/can highlight that one of the parameters in a function call doesn't match but you can execute the function.
- Exception??
    - When the call raise an Exception then we know what to do but sometimes we don't get an Exception only a weird result.

```python
def multipler(a: int, b: int):
    return a * b


product = multipler(3, 4)
# >>> 12

product_2 = multipler('Hello', 'World') # Will be highlighted in some IDE's
# >>> TypeError

product_3 = multipler('Hello', 4)
# >>> 'HelloHelloHelloHello'
# No Exception but the result isnâ€™t really what we expect
```
___
Now we can say that we will check the types in the function body to prevent this.
___

```python
def multipler(a: int, b: int):
    if isinstance(a, int) and isinstance(b, int):
        return a * b
    ...
```
But when your function needs a lot of different parameters with different types you have to create a lot of noising code.<br>
And why should we then use typing in our parameters??

### The solution
I created a decorator called <b>@match_typing</b> which will check at runtime if the parameters which will be used when <br>
calling this function is from the same type as you have defined.<br><br>

## Requirements
<b>Python 3.7 > <=3.9</b>

- ujson
- pytest

## Extension
#### strongtpying_module

- A __package__ written by my own in __Cython__ to speed up the time for checking the parameters <br>
  with this package you can achieve a __boost__ by the __factor 3__ and higher
- you only need to install this package via `pip install strongtyping-modules`
